# Windows Compatibility Improvements

## Summary

This document summarizes the Windows compatibility improvements made to the Codex CLI during development and testing.

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. Enhanced Command Translation & Recovery

- **Advanced PowerShell integration** with proper command wrapping
  - `ls` → `Get-ChildItem` (with PowerShell context)
  - `cat` → `Get-Content` (with proper arguments)
  - `grep` → `Select-String` (with pattern matching)
  - `tee` → `Tee-Object` (with input handling)
  - `dir` → `Get-ChildItem` (with PowerShell wrapping)
- **Complex shell operation handling**
  - Auto-conversion of `echo > file` to `apply_patch`
  - Detection and fallback for pipe operations
  - Error recovery with automatic retry using different approaches
- **Path normalization** for Windows file paths with auto-correction
- **Command validation** with enhanced warnings and suggestions

### 2. Automatic Error Recovery System

- **Real-time error detection** with exit code monitoring
- **Intelligent fallback strategies** for failed commands
- **Auto-recovery execution** for safe operations (apply_patch, PowerShell)
- **Recovery logging and user notification** with success/failure feedback
- **Command-specific recovery patterns** for different operation types

### 3. Enhanced File Operations

- **File backup system** before applying patches
- **Patch preview** functionality with change analysis
- **Automatic apply_patch fallback** for failed file operations
- **Windows-specific path handling** with forward slash auto-correction
- **Error recovery suggestions** with actionable alternatives

### 4. Provider Integration & Testing

- **Gemini API integration** fully tested with advanced examples
- **camerascii example testing** demonstrating complex webapp creation
- **Multi-provider support** maintained and enhanced
- **Proper API key handling** for different providers

### 4. Testing Infrastructure

- **Comprehensive test suite** for different scenarios
- **Example applications** tested successfully
- **Approval policy testing** with `--full-auto` mode

## Successfully Tested Examples

### Basic Functionality

- ✅ Simple file creation (`hello.txt`)
- ✅ HTML webpage generation
- ✅ JavaScript application creation
- ✅ Complex web applications (webcam access)

### Advanced Features

- ✅ Real-time webcam to ASCII art conversion
- ✅ Interactive web applications
- ✅ Multi-file project generation
- ✅ Command execution in sandbox environment

## Key Technical Improvements

### Agent Loop Enhancements (`agent-loop.ts`)

- Enhanced command validation pipeline
- Better error recovery mechanisms
- Improved Windows command adaptation
- Comprehensive logging and debugging

### Command Validation (`command-validator.ts`)

- Cross-platform command compatibility
- Path normalization for Windows
- Security validation for dangerous commands
- Helpful suggestions for common mistakes

### File Operations (`file-operations.ts`)

- Automated backup creation before modifications
- Patch preview with file impact analysis
- Safe file manipulation with rollback support

## Usage Examples

### Testing with Gemini Provider

```powershell
# Set API key
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"

# Run with full automation
node codex-cli/dist/cli.js -p gemini -m gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20 --full-auto -q "your prompt here"
```

### Example Test Script

Use `test-gemini-examples.ps1` for comprehensive testing of the CLI functionality.
